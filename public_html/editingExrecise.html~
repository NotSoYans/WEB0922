    <h1>Editing Exercises</h1>
    <p>
      So this stuff is just a bunch of ideas for improving skills in video editing. Some of these I might actually use.

      <ul>    
        <p>
          <li>Cut together a song (or songs) from <a href="http://forum.nin.com/bb/read.php?52,378166">Nine Inch Nail's Lights in the Sky tour</a>. I know not everyone is a NIN fan, but I chose it because <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/01/09/nins-newest-game-changer-hd-concert-footage-via-bittorrent/">this is officially sanctioned use of publicly released media</a>. Now, this was several years ago, so I don't know if the torrent is still live, but it's worth a shot, right?</li> <br /> <br />

Just note that some of the songs still belong to Universal, so they may illicit a takedown notice on YouTube, but if you're willing to navigate through NIN's release history it's possible to pick out a decent amount and make your own artistic work out of it. Evidence: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Version_of_the_Truth#The_Gift">The Gift</a>.
