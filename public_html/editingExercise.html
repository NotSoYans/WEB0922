    <h1>Editing Exercises</h1>
    <p>
      So this stuff is just a bunch of ideas for improving skills in video editing. Some of these I might actually use.

Cut together a song (or songs) from <a href="http://forum.nin.com/bb/read.php?52,378166">Nine Inch Nail's Lights in the Sky tour</a>. I know not everyone is a NIN fan, but I chose it because <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/01/09/nins-newest-game-changer-hd-concert-footage-via-bittorrent/">this is officially sanctioned use of publicly released media</a>. Now, this was several years ago, so I don't know if the torrent is still live, but it's worth a shot, right?</li> <br />

Just note that some of the songs still belong to Universal, so they may illicit a takedown notice on YouTube, but if you're willing to navigate through NIN's release history it's possible to pick out a decent amount and make your own artistic work out of it. Evidence: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Version_of_the_Truth#The_Gift">The Gift</a>.

Another challenge (shamelessly ripped off from a Radio Production project I did in college): make a video that tells a day in your life. Use your cell phone and just shoot a few scenes. We're not talking long, like three minutes is what I'm guessing would be about right. Don't invent a fictional piece, though. Maybe you could plan to have this day be the events of a weekend trip, or perhaps it's to reinforce the humdrum reality of working for eight hours a day. That's your choice, but the video should be grounded in reality.

Here's one I did in high school: cut a trailer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/feature_films">The Internet Archive</a> has a collection of feature films you could work on (perhaps groups of people could agree to each cut their own version of a trailer and compare the pieces afterwards). Do note, though, some films on the IA are copyrighted, and are falsely uploaded as public domain (one example: Ed Wood's infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Outer_Space#Release_and_title_changes">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a>).

Make an oral history piece. For those who aren't familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_history">oral histories</a> they're basically stories told by someone who was there, or alive during the time. So that could be as something as mundane and your parents telling you about what it was like growing up in a certain decade, or more historically significant, like having them recall some of their experiences during (Civil Rights Movement, Viet Nam, Nixon Impeachment, Moon Landing, Clinton Impeachment, 9/11 attack, Gulf War, whatever). You could do this by interviewing them simply with your cell phone, or use an audio recorder and show the story with photos and stock footage. It's up to you.

Go out and shoot something yourself! You don't need a professional camera and gear to make something fun. Anything you have on hand will do to start with. A point-and-shoot camera, or even a cell phone, is enough to get the ball rolling. Talk to your friends, come up with a story, go outside and shoot it!

If you want to go more high-end than just playing with a cell phone (and you're in the US), consider getting involved with your local Public Access channel. For a small fee you can become a member, which allows you to take classes and borrow professional grade equipment. It also gives you the opportunity to work with other people on their projects and have them help you with yours. It's a great place to meet like-minded people and to learn the craft. Tremendous bang for your buck.

      </ul>

/The ground rules for all of these ideas, though: <strong>no excuses</strong>. Do your best to make something work, even if it's a kludge. If it doesn't work, find a way around using it. Your decision./
