This is a WIP website project that I'm using in order to learn more about WebDev.
~~Don't for the love of god try to do stuff on the fucking server. That shit is slow.
At least on bloody sublime. :/~~
Doing stuff on server is just fine, if done on gedit. Sublime is supremely slow tho. 
Also it's not even necessary to be on the server constantly.
